  abstract = {Traditional approaches to the preclinical investigation of cancer
	therapies rely on the use of established cell lines maintained in
	serum-based growth media. This is particularly true of small-cell
	lung cancer (SCLC), where surgically resected tissue is rarely available.
	Recent attention has focused on the need for better models that preserve
	the integrity of cancer stem cell populations, as well as three-dimensional
	tumor-stromal interactions. Here we describe a primary xenograft
	model of SCLC in which endobronchial tumor specimens obtained from
	chemo-naive patients are serially propagated in vivo in immunodeficient
	mice. In parallel, cell lines grown in conventional tissue culture
	conditions were derived from each xenograft line, passaged for 6
	months, and then reimplanted to generate secondary xenografts. Using
	the Affymetrix platform, we analyzed gene expression in primary xenograft,
	xenograft-derived cell line, and secondary xenograft, and compared
	these data to similar analyses of unrelated primary SCLC samples
	and laboratory models. When compared with normal lung, primary tumors,
	xenografts, and cell lines displayed a gene expression signature
	specific for SCLC. Comparison of gene expression within the xenograft
	model identified a group of tumor-specific genes expressed in primary
	SCLC and xenografts that was lost during the transition to tissue
	culture and that was not regained when the tumors were reestablished
	as secondary xenografts. Such changes in gene expression may be a
	common feature of many cancer cell culture systems, with functional
	implications for the use of such models for preclinical drug development.},

  abstract = {Highly tumorigenic cancer cell (HTC) populations have been identified
	for a variety of solid tumors and assigned stem cell properties.
	Strategies for identifying HTCs in solid tumors have been primarily
	empirical rather than rational, particularly in epithelial tumors,
	which are responsible for 80\% of cancer deaths. We report evidence
	for a spatially restricted bladder epithelial (urothelial) differentiation
	program in primary urothelial cancers (UCs) and in UC xenografts.
	We identified a highly tumorigenic UC cell compartment that resembles
	benign urothelial stem cells (basal cells), co-expresses the 67-kDa
	laminin receptor and the basal cell-specific cytokeratin CK17, and
	lacks the carcinoembryonic antigen family member CEACAM6 (CD66c).
	This multipotent compartment resides at the tumor-stroma interface,
	is easily identified on histologic sections, and possesses most,
	if not all, of the engraftable tumor-forming ability in the parental
	xenograft. We analyzed differential expression of genes and pathways
	in basal-like cells versus more differentiated cells. Among these,
	we found significant enrichment of pathways comprising "hallmarks"
	of cancer, and pharmacologically targetable signaling pathways, including
	Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, Notch,
	focal adhesion, mammalian target of rapamycin, epidermal growth factor
	receptor (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog [ErbB]),
	and wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt). The basal/HTC
	gene expression signature was essentially invisible within the context
	of nontumorigenic cell gene expression and overlapped significantly
	with genes driving progression and death in primary human UC. The
	spatially restricted epithelial differentiation program described
	here represents a conceptual advance in understanding cellular heterogeneity
	of carcinomas and identifies basal-like HTCs as attractive targets
	for cancer therapy.},

	appropriate platform assessments become more important. Here we present

	we noticed that none of the previously published papers consider
	differences between labs. For this study, a consortium of ten laboratories
	from the Washington, DC-Baltimore, USA, area was formed to compare
	data obtained from three widely used platforms using identical RNA
	samples. We used appropriate statistical analysis to demonstrate
	that there are relatively large differences in data obtained in labs
	using the same platform, but that the results from the best-performing
	labs agree rather well.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: In the Affymetrix GeneChip system, preprocessing occurs

	A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures.
	At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted. RESULTS:
	We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike
	in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction,
	one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on
	performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve
	accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results
	put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some
	of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information
	regarding precision and accuracy. A handful of methods stand out
	as providing the best balance using spike-in data with the older
	U95A array, although different experiments on more current arrays
	may benchmark differently. AVAILABILITY: The affycomp package, now
	version 1.5.2, continues to be available as part of the Bioconductor

  abstract = {Cancer cells differentiate along specific lineages that largely determine
	their clinical and biologic behavior. Distinct cancer phenotypes
	from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression
	repertoires established in the embryo and maintained after malignant
	transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to
	examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a tractable developmental
	program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression
	in the murine prostate rudiment at three time points during the first
	48 h of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion
	of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding urogenital sinus mesenchyme.
	Here, we show that androgen exposure regulates genes previously implicated
	in prostate carcinogenesis comprising pathways for the phosphatase
	and tensin homolog (PTEN), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogen-activated
	protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling along with cellular programs
	regulating such 'hallmarks' of cancer as angiogenesis, apoptosis,
	migration and proliferation. We found statistically significant evidence
	for novel androgen-induced gene regulation events that establish
	and/or maintain prostate cell fate. These include modulation of gene
	expression through microRNAs, expression of specific transcription
	factors, and regulation of their predicted targets. By querying public
	gene expression databases from other tissues, we found that rather
	than generally characterizing androgen exposure or epithelial budding,
	the early prostate development program more closely resembles the
	program for human prostate cancer. Most importantly, early androgen-regulated
	genes and functional themes associated with prostate development
	were highly enriched in contrasts between increasingly lethal forms
	of prostate cancer, confirming a 'reactivation' of embryonic pathways
	for proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer progression. Among
	the genes with the most significant links to the development and
	cancer, we highlight coordinate induction of the transcription factor
	Sox9 and suppression of the proapoptotic phospholipid-binding protein
	Annexin A1 that link early prostate development to early prostate
	carcinogenesis. These results credential early prostate development
	as a reliable and valid model system for the investigation of genes
	and pathways that drive prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Spotted arrays are often printed with probes in duplicate
	or triplicate, but current methods for assessing differential expression
	are not able to make full use of the resulting information. The usual
	practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each
	probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the
	loss of valuable information about genewise variability. RESULTS:
	A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array
	replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength
	of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate
	linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common
	value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves
	the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and
	thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially
	expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes
	methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The
	method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving
	calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in
	RNA. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows
	that the common correlation method results in substantially better
	discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which
	are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may
	be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances
	when the sample size is small. AVAILABILITY: The methodology is implemented
	in the limma software package for R, available from the CRAN repository
